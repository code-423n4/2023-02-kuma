# ‚ú® So you want to sponsor a contest

This `README.md` contains a set of checklists for our contest collaboration.

Your contest will use two repos:

- **a _contest_ repo** (this one), which is used for scoping your contest and for providing information to contestants (wardens)
- **a _findings_ repo**, where issues are submitted (shared with you after the contest)

Ultimately, when we launch the contest, this contest repo will be made public and will contain the smart contracts to be reviewed and all the information needed for contest participants. The findings repo will be made public after the contest report is published and your team has mitigated the identified issues.

Some of the checklists in this doc are for **C4 (üê∫)** and some of them are for **you as the contest sponsor (‚≠êÔ∏è)**.

# Repo setup

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Sponsor: Add code to this repo

- [ ] Create a PR to this repo with the below changes:
- [ ] Provide a self-contained repository with working commands that will build (at least) all in-scope contracts, and commands that will run tests producing gas reports for the relevant contracts.
- [ ] Make sure your code is thoroughly commented using the [NatSpec format](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.5.10/natspec-format.html#natspec-format).
- [ ] Please have final versions of contracts and documentation added/updated in this repo **no less than 24 hours prior to contest start time.**
- [ ] Be prepared for a üö®code freezeüö® for the duration of the contest ‚Äî important because it establishes a level playing field. We want to ensure everyone's looking at the same code, no matter when they look during the contest. (Note: this includes your own repo, since a PR can leak alpha to our wardens!)

---

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Sponsor: Edit this README

Under "SPONSORS ADD INFO HERE" heading below, include the following:

- [ ] Modify the bottom of this `README.md` file to describe how your code is supposed to work with links to any relevent documentation and any other criteria/details that the C4 Wardens should keep in mind when reviewing. ([Here's a well-constructed example.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-foundation#readme))
  - [ ] When linking, please provide all links as full absolute links versus relative links
  - [ ] All information should be provided in markdown format (HTML does not render on Code4rena.com)
- [ ] Under the "Scope" heading, provide the name of each contract and:
  - [ ] source lines of code (excluding blank lines and comments) in each
  - [ ] external contracts called in each
  - [ ] libraries used in each
- [ ] Describe any novel or unique curve logic or mathematical models implemented in the contracts
- [ ] Does the token conform to the ERC-20 standard? In what specific ways does it differ?
- [ ] Describe anything else that adds any special logic that makes your approach unique
- [ ] Identify any areas of specific concern in reviewing the code
- [ ] Optional / nice to have: pre-record a high-level overview of your protocol (not just specific smart contract functions). This saves wardens a lot of time wading through documentation.
- [ ] See also: [this checklist in Notion](https://code4rena.notion.site/Key-info-for-Code4rena-sponsors-f60764c4c4574bbf8e7a6dbd72cc49b4#0cafa01e6201462e9f78677a39e09746)
- [ ] Delete this checklist and all text above the line below when you're ready.

# Overview

This repo contains source contracts and testing suites for the MCAG contracts and the KUMA Protocol. Each corresponding project directory contains documentation in the /docs folder.

The [src/kuma-protocol/](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-02-kuma/src/kuma-protocol/) folder contains the contracts that comprise the decentralized KUMA protocol. See [docs/kuma-protocol/](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-02-kuma/docs/kuma-protocol/) for KUMA protocol docs.

The [src/mcag-contracts/](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-02-kuma/src/mcag-contracts/) contains contracts that are managed by the centralized MCAG entity. See [docs/mcag-contracts/](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-02-kuma/docs/mcag-contracts/) for MCAG contracts docs.

# Tests

This repo contains relevant tests for the two source projects. To run tests:

1. Make sure all git submodules are installed using `git submodule update --init`
2. Run `forge test`

Make sure `forge` is at least on the following version: `forge 0.2.0 (1a56901 2023-02-15T00:05:20.802314Z)`

## Running Static Analysis

The root folder contains a `slither.config.json` file that can be used to run static analysis on the `kuma-protocol` project. Refer to the [foundry docs](https://book.getfoundry.sh/config/static-analyzers?highlight=slither.config#slither) on how to run Slither

## Invariant testing

For the following files the invariants should be run with `fail_on_revert = true` :

- [KIBToken.fail.on.revert.invariant](./test/kuma-protocol/invariants/KIBToken.fail.on.revert.invariant.sol)
- [KUMASwap.fail.on.revert.invariant](./test/kuma-protocol/invariants/KUMASwap.fail.on.revert.invariant.sol)
